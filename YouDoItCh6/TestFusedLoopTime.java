/**
 * Purpose:
 * The TestFusedLoopTime class is designed to compare the execution times of two different loop structures: 
 * one where two methods (method1 and method2) are called in separate loops and another where both methods 
 * are called within a single loop. This comparison helps in understanding the performance implications of 
 * using fused (combined) loops versus separate loops.
 * 
 * Description:
 * The class contains the following main components:
 * 1. Variables: 
 *    - startTime and endTime to capture the start and end nanoseconds of the loop executions.
 *    - x as the loop control variable.
 *    - Constants REPEAT and FACTOR to define the number of loop iterations and the conversion factor 
 *      from nanoseconds to milliseconds, respectively.
 * 2. Loop Structures:
 *    - Two separate loops, each calling method1 and method2 respectively, 5 million times.
 *    - A single loop that calls both method1 and method2 5 million times each.
 * 3. Output:
 *    - After each loop structure execution, the elapsed time in milliseconds is printed to the console.
 * 4. Stub Methods:
 *    - method1 and method2 are stub methods with no internal logic, serving as placeholders for the demonstration.
